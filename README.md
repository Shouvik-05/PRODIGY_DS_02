# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of the **Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship Task 2**.

## 📌 Objective

To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The goal is to explore relationships between variables and identify trends that affected passenger survival.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Prodigy_Infotech_Task_2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all code and plots
- `Prodigy_Infotech_Task_2.pdf` – PDF version of the notebook (for report)
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset (optional)

## 📊 Key Explorations

- Survival distribution overall
- Survival by gender and passenger class
- Age distribution and its impact on survival
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
